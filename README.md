My sentiment-analysis-api project is a user-friendly tool that makes it easy to analyze the emotional tone of any text. Built using Node.js, Express, and TensorFlow.js, the API processes text inputs and determines whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The goal was to create a straightforward interface where users could simply enter their text on a web page, and the API would provide a sentiment score in real-time. The backend is hosted on Render.com, ensuring that the API is accessible online for testing, while the front-end is built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to connect seamlessly with the API.

I aimed to make the experience intuitive—users enter a sentence, click a button, and get their sentiment analysis instantly. To ensure smooth communication between the user interface hosted on GitHub Pages and the backend API, I configured CORS settings, allowing cross-origin requests. This project allowed me to blend my technical skills in backend development with a focus on user interaction, demonstrating my ability to bring AI-powered features to life in a simple, engaging way. It’s been a great way to explore both the technical and creative aspects of building AI-driven web tools.
